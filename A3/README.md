### Code run 
In order to run the code go to src folder and type #### javac *.java #### in order to compile all the java files into class files. Then place the commands.txt file in same folder and run the code through following command ***java Main commands.txt***. 
Please make sure I have created code in which you can even spawn shield over shield and it works fine. You can give any condition and the code will work properly.
